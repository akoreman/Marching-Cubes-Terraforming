# Terraforming Prototype
Early WIP. Terraforming game prototype based on my implementation of the marching cubes algorithm. Inspired by the gameplay of Astroneer.

**Currently Implemented**
- Using the marching cubes algorithm to visualise noise functions.
- Spawning and de-spawning chunks to generate infinitely large marching cubes worlds.
- View frustum culling by calculating the camera draw volume and de-spawning chunks not in camera view.
- Change the geomtry during runtime by changing the underlying scalar field.
