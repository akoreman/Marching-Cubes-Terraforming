# Terraforming Prototype
WIP. Terraforming prototype based on my implementation of the marching cubes algorithm. Inspired by the gameplay of Astroneer.

**Currently Implemented**
- Using the marching cubes algorithm to visualise arbitrary scalar field functions.
- Spawning and de-spawning chunks to generate infinitely large marching cubes worlds.
- View frustum culling by calculating the camera draw volume and de-spawning chunks not in camera view.
- Change the geomtry during runtime by changing the underlying scalar field.
- First person mouse controls.

**To Do**
- Implement height map initialisation to start in a more interesting enviroment.
- Implement brush teraforming to manipulate multiple points at once.
